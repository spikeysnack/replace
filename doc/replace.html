<h2>NAME</h2>
replace
<blockquote>
   Rename a list of filenames based upon a matching string 
   and a replacement string. 
</blockquote>

<h2>USAGE</h2>
<code>
<font size="4" color="blue">
<pre>
replace   [-a] [-f] [-n &lt;int&gt;] [-t] [-q] [-v] [match] [replacement] [file list]
          [-h]
          [-u] [-v] [-t]
          [-V]
</pre>
</font>
</code>
<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
<code> 
<font size="4" color="blue">
<pre>
       -a    --all      replace all matches in each filename

       -f    --force    do not ask Y/N before renaming files

       -h    --help     print this message

       -n <int>   --num <int>     replace up to n matches per filename

       -t    --test    test mode -- do not actually change filenames

       -q    --quiet   rename files with no output

       -u    --undo    reverse the last run of replace

       -v    --verbose  print out lots of things as they happen

       -V    --version  print out version
</pre>
</font>
</code> 

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><p>

<font color="blue">replace</font> is a straightforward text substitution program
that operates on lists of filenames.
<p> 
Its syntax is somewhat simpler than the regular expression syntax 
of the <i>sed</i> and the <i>rename</i> utilities, 
and it is less dangerous than the <i>tr</i> utility.
<p>
There are a few restrictions built in to stop bad things from happening.

<h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<font size="4">
<i>required</i>:
         ANSI C compiler
         standard C library and headers
<i>optional</i>: 
         &lt;libgc&gt; garbage collector library <i>(autodetected)</i>

</font>
</pre
</blockquote>
<h2>QUICK INSTALL</h2>
<blockquote>
<pre>
     make
     sudo make install

     The default installation is: 
     FILE             DIR
<hl>
     replace          /usr/local/bin
     replace.1        /usr/local/share/man/man1/replace.1
     documentation    /usr/local/share/doc/replace
</pre>
</font>
</code>

<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<blockquote>
 </blockquote>
<pre>
This utility does a chore that can be done with 
the traditional unix tools, but then you have to
know sed regular expressions, and that is a chore 
within itself sometimes.

The most common use for <font color="blue">replace</font> 
would be for changing the name of
a group of files in a directory, for some reason. 


replace simply searches a list of filenames given
to it, matches a string in their names, replaces it 
with a replacement string, and renames the files accordingly.
<p>
It has a test mode to make sure the replacement is warranted as typed,
protections and warnings agains super-use (use by root or sudo),
and takes some basic precautions like not creating illegal filenames,
not overwriting existing files, and avoiding problematic file names
such as leading dashes or slashes or punctuation marks, and double spaces.
<p>
It will also not create the files <font color="green">&quot;.&quot;</font> and <font color="green"> &quot;..&quot;</font> , as these are aliases for
the current and parent directory to the current working directory 
in unix-like operating systems. 
<h3>Directory names, directories being files themselves, are valid input to <font color="blue">replace</font>.<h3> 
</pre>
  
<h2>INTERACTIVE</h2>
Interactive mode is the safest if not the most efficient way to use <font color="blue">replace</font>. 
<p>
It asks the user for a yes or no before each file is renamed.
<p>

<i>Force mode (-f)</i> goes ahead without user interaction.<br>
It is quite convenient and fast, but should not be used thoughtlessly or
serious messing-up of directories full of files may result.


<h2>UNDO</h2><p>

One level of undo is implemented.<br>
When run an undo file is created that can reverse the last run of the program.<br>
The file is placed in the users home directory in the subdirectory <font color="green">".replace" </font>.<br>
The default undo file name is <i>replace_undo  ($HOME/.replace/replace_undo)</i>.<br>
<pre>
<i>replace_undo</i> is a plain text file with file name pairs, one pair per line, of
the original file name and the new one. Upon an undo operation, each
line is taken up and the file is renamed from its new name back to 
its original name in a kind of short-cut operation without calculation.
</pre>
 
<h3>Quick undo is not to be relied on, but it could save some work 
if and when an oops momemt happens. </h3>

Test mode is the recommended way to see what would happen. <b><i>Please.</i></b>
<p>

<h2>FILES</h2>
<blockquote>
<pre>
       /usr/local/bin/replace                program binary 

       $HOME/.replace/replace_undo           user undo file (text) 

       /usr/local/share/man/man1/replace.1   man page for replace

       /usr/local/share/doc/replace/         documentation for replace 
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
<pre>
<blockquote>
change all .doc files to .txt because they are actually plain text files. 
<p>
<code>
<font size="4" color="blue">
$ replace  .doc .txt *
</font>
</code>
<font size="3">
     (The shell expands the asterisk to all files in the dir, and those 
     not matching are ignored. if there was already a .txt file in the directory
     that would be overwriten, the program halts before that happens.)
     (Please see the man page for replace(1) for some more examples.)
</font> 
<code>
<font size="4" color="blue">
replace  2105  2016 *
</font>
</code>
<font size="3">
fix a typo in filenames
<font>
<code> 
<font size="4" color="blue">
      replace  -t -v  -n 2  00 0 *.jpg
</font>
</code>
<font size="3">
     test only the result(s) of
     replacing a double-zero with a single one
     with a max of two matches per file
</font>
<font size="4" color="0x330099">
 002_CONCERT_007002.jpg ==> O2_CONCERT_07002.jpg
</font>
<h3>     (hint:  use * for all files in dir)</h3>
<code>
<font size="4" color="blue">
       replace -uvf
</font>
</code>
     undo the last rename operation
     print out operations
     do not stop for user input (Y/N)
</blockquote>
</pre>

<h2>BUGS</h2>
<pre>
<font size="4" color="0x660099">
Edge cases:

Substitutions may attempt to rename files to names that already exist in the path.
<font color="blue"><i>replace</i></font> will abort before any files are destroyed or overwritten. 
This could lead to a situation wherein some files are renamed, and some are not.

Multiple sequential runs of the undo function are <u>not</u> reversible.
To redo after an undo you must re-run <font color="blue"><i>replace<i/></font> with the original parameters.

The undo file is updated for each successful rename, but only for the last complete run. 
It is recommended to use the -t test flag before any complicated operation.
That way you may judge the results before executing a batch rename command.
