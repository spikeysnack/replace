       replace renames files.

       It substitutes one string of characters in the file names for another.

       replace takes as input a matching string, a replacement string,  and  a
       list of filenames.

       It  replaces from one to all occurances of the matching string with the
       replacement string in a given list of  file  names,  then  renames  the
       matching files accordingly.

       It  is  designed  to  be flexible yet careful not to destroy files.  It
       will not rename files to bad or impossible filenames.

       It implements one level of undo via an undo  file.   The  undo-file  is
       created and placed in the user's home directory.

       (default: $HOME/.replace/replace_undo)

       Edge cases:
              Substitutions may attempt to  rename  files
              to  names  that  already exist in the path.
              The replace program will abort  before  any
              files  are  destroyed or overwritten.  This
              could lead  to  a  situation  wherein  some
              files are renamed, and some are not.

              Multiple  sequential runs of the undo func‐
              tion are not reflexive.  To redo  after  an
              undo you must re-run replace with the orig‐
              inal parameters.

              The undo file is updated for each  success‐
              ful  rename, but only for the last complete
              run.  It is recommended to use the -t  test
              flag   before  any  complicated  operation.
              That way you may judge the  results  before
              executing a batch rename command.
